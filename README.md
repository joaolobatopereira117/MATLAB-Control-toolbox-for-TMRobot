# TMRobot Series Toolbox

The goal for this project is to develop a set of functions that allow the control of the Omron TMRobot Series thru an external device using Matlab.
All the functions developed have diferent capabilities wich separates them into diferent categories, setters, getters, connection, movement, gripper, simulation, kinematics and test arm configuration.

This toolbox can be used in two different ways. The user can opt to operate using only the individual function library Table 1 or rely in the more organized structure TMRobot Class wich methods use the individual functions too, Table 2.

In order to use this functions and TMRobot Class its necessary to have PETER CORKE Robotic toolbox and the Matlab Instrument control Toolbox.
