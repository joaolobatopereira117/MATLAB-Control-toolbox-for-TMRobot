# Matlab-library-that-allows-users-to-control-omron-TMRobots-thru-an-external-device

The goal for this project is to develop a set of functions that allow the control of the Omron TMRobot Series thru an external device using Matlab.
All the functions developed have diferent capabilities wich separates them into diferent categories, setters, getters, connection, movement, gripper and symulation.


In order to use this functions and TMRobot Class its necessary to have PETER CORKE Robotic toolbox and the Matlab Instrument Toolbox.
